# CS229-Project
Grace Kim and Priscilla Lui

This is a project applying text-to-image GANs to children's stories to produce illustrations. We explore:
1. StoryGAN trained on a style-transferred VIST dataset, using description-in-isolation captions, and
2. DF-GAN trained on MS-COCO

Our starting sources:
